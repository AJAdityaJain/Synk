Synk - Stay in Sync Securely

This project is a chatting platform (just frontend... havent uploaded backend to github cuz i am lazy). 
This is a completely secure platform with:
  Password Hashing
  Diffie-hellman key exchanges
  Simple Universal Secrecy (SUS)
 
Encryption keys are 112 digit.
Whatsapp only has 60 digit keys.

One can 
  create contacts
  chat privately
  chat in groups
  send emojis
  upload profile pics
  chat securely
  
One can't
  hack it - After putting this online i would provide an open challenge to hackers to get access to the chats
